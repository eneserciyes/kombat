# Introduction

The Grand E.V.I.L. Banquet is approaching, where the worlds’ 400 most Eminent Villainous Illegitimate Leaders (E.V.I.L.) will be gathered together in the banquet hall to celebrate their nefarious plans. You are the leader of the Group Of Obscure Detectives (G.O.O.D.), and are planning to send spies to the banquet to eavesdrop on E.V.I.L. in the best way you can. 

You have stolen a map of the seating plan, which shows where everyone will be seated in the banquet hall throughout the event (a convenient 200x200 grid). You can place K spies carrying wiretaps anywhere inside the banquet hall; each spy's wiretap will enable you to listen to E.V.I.L. members within a radius L.

However, E.V.I.L. have been tipped off there are spies in their midst. After the spies have all been placed, E.V.I.L. places Y anti-spy devices in the banquet hall one after the other. As soon as an anti-spy device is placed, it causes any wiretaps within a detection radius Z to explode - revealing the location/s of any spy/s around it and rendering them useless. 

Every person at the banquet has a individual value V based on their rank in E.V.I.L. G.O.O.D.’s score is the product of the values of the people covered by your spies after the anti-spy devices have been placed. 

Good luck, and may G.O.O.D. prevail.
